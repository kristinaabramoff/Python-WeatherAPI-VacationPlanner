# Python API Challenge README

## Background
The analysis aims to assess how weather attributes vary with latitude and determine suitable vacation destinations based on specific weather conditions using API calls.

## Overview
In this assignment, we created a new repository named python-api-challenge and added two main Jupyter notebooks: WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb. These notebooks are pivotal in visualizing weather data and planning future vacations based on weather conditions.

## Part 1: WeatherPy
In WeatherPy, we utilized the citipy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API to gather weather data for over 500 cities. We then created scatter plots to illustrate the relationships between weather variables (Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed) and latitude. Additionally, we computed linear regression for each relationship to gain deeper insights into how weather attributes change with latitude.

## Part 2: VacationPy
VacationPy involved using weather data to plan future vacations. Leveraging Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API, we visualized cities on a map, with each point sized according to humidity. We narrowed down the dataset to find cities with ideal weather conditions and used the Geoapify API to identify nearby hotels for each city based on specific weather conditions, enriching the map with this information.

## Conclusion
This project has honed our skills in Python programming, API integration, data visualization, and problem-solving. It's a testament to our growing proficiency in leveraging data to answer real-world questions and plan personalized travel experiences.
